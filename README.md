### C# Rapid Application Development

* [Jeebs](https://github.com/bfren/jeebs) is my primary project, a series of .NET libraries written in C#.
* [Maybe](https://github.com/bfren/maybe) is a Maybe monad for C#.
* [Rnd](https://github.com/bfren/rnd) is a series of random value generators.

### Docker Ecosystem

Alongside that I also maintain an [ecosystem](https://github.com/bfren/docker) of Docker images which I use for almost all my web hosting.
