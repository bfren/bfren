### C# Rapid Application Development

My primary project is [Jeebs](https://github.com/bfren/jeebs), a series of .NET 6.0 libraries written in C# to help develop applications quickly.  Additionally [Maybe](https://github.com/bfren/maybe) (Maybe monad for C#) and [Rnd](https://github.com/bfren/rnd) (random value generators) provide useful functions.

### Docker Ecosystem

Alongside that I also maintain an [ecosystem](https://github.com/bfren/docker) of Docker images which I use for almost all my web hosting.
