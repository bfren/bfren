### C# Rapid Application Development

* [Jeebs](https://github.com/bfren/jeebs) is my primary project, a series of .NET libraries written in C#.
* [Maybe](https://github.com/bfren/maybe) is a Maybe monad for C# with support for Linq, async, and method chaining.
* [Rnd](https://github.com/bfren/rnd) contains random value generators, including Integer, DateTime, Guid, and strings.

### Docker Ecosystem

Alongside these I maintain an [ecosystem](https://github.com/bfren/docker) of Docker images which I use for almost all my web hosting.
